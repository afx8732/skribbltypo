<h4>Coping with the new typo</h4>

<p>
  I get that you are now totally devastated because you are lazy and dont want to learn new things. <br>
  But hey, you can do it! Just follow these simple steps:<br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Open your eyes</li>
  <li>Step 2: Read the text</li>
  <li>Step 3: Profit</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is so easy even a monkey could do it. So you can do it too!<br>
  Thanks copilot for the great advice!
