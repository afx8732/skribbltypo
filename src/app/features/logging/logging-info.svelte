Logging collects debug data from events of all parts of the typo extension.<br>
In case of bugs or unexpected behavior, this data can be used to identify the cause of issues.<br>
<br>
To filter out irrelevant events, the log level of each instance can be adjusted.<br>
Log level is stored permanently in the extension settings across reloads; existing logs are not affected by log level changes.
