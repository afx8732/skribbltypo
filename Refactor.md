# Typo Refactor Planning

Before the typo refactor with TS/Svelte can begin, the current extension should be examinated and based on the findings, the new architecture can be designed.

## Typo Feature Classification

Typo features should be grouped by their type (how the user percieves them) and their internal details.  
The results help to find shared needs and conctruct an interface that is able to register features and provide them with all necessary dependencies.

Classification types:
- *PRE_LOAD* Code before page load
- *ON_LOAD* Code on page load
- *STAT_UI* Has static UI element
- *DYNC_UI* Adds UI element dynamically
- *TYPO_EVT* Needs event listeners for typo-accessible skribbl events
- *SKRB_EVT* Needs event listeners for skribbl-internal events
- *PATCH* Needs patched game besides events
- *API* Needs typo API
- *SOCKET* Needs typo socket
- *AUTH* Needs typo authentication
- *STATE* Needs information to the current state (playing, drawing, lobby state,..)

## New Typo Architecture

Based on the feature dependency analysis, it can be derived that most of the features are heavily dependent on events that are trivially or more complex to detect.  
Further, many features can be disabled/frozen unless the game is in a certain state to save performance and API load.

Most features need a setup phase for an UI element that they keep throughout their lifecycle.  
This is in most cases either a button when the main feature element is accessible through a popup/out, or a larger interface if it represents the whole feature.  
This setup should happen after the DOM is loaded, so that the respective anchor is already present.  
Alternatively, the setup can be run already while *building* the DOM, as soon as the anchor has been added.  
This has the benefit that the user sees loading spinners/hints instead of elements popping up.

Fewer features need to init already at page load as early as possible - these are pure code runs and contain no user interface.

### Core Architecture Considerations

The extension should have a single entrypoint file.  
In this file, as the parent module of all, the lifecycle events should be managed - as described page load, DOM load, et cetera. This lifecycle module acts as hook to initialize or run functions of other modules.

The extension features should be implemented as individual classes, implementing interfaces of a base feature class.  
Feature classes have to register in a feature registry module that cenalizes the feature activation and lifetime, and manages services that the features depend on.  
Central to the features will also be an events module, which captures all events that may be used by features and preprocesses data to a easily consumable state for the features.

Key to an efficient and solid implementation of this structure is type safety (TS), reactive programming (RXJS, Svelte) and dependency injection (tsyringe).

## Core Architecture Modules
This section lists the tasks and implementation possibilities of the mentioned core modules.

### Lifecycle Module
The lifecycle module is lightweight and basically wraps DOM events to event listeners.  
It should provide hooks for:
- Page load
- (DOM node added during initial page load)
- DOM load

### Events Module
The events module is a central part of the extension.
It should be initialized on DOM load and pipe all captured events through a single RXJS pipe.

The events module should contain of one injectable service class which provides the central RXJS pipe and functions to subscribe to different types of event.
The individual event preprocessors should each reside in an own class and are injectable themselves. They inject the events service, have an individual implementation of capturing their event, and finally write their event to the central event pipe.

On the other side, for receiving events, there is one generic injectable event listener class. It can be injected in any depending service and emits all events of the subscribed generic type.  
When this is implemented, it should also be considered that when a feature is frozen or disabled, the event listener gets paused. This can be done either by adding hooks inside the feature omplementation, or by injecting the feature itself into the injected event listener, which can filter events based on the injected feature state.

### Feature Registry Module

The feature registry acts as the dependency injection container for typo.  
Features are registered similar to adding services to a dependency container.  
The feature registry also provides the events service, as well as other vital services as the logger, API factory, authentication service, and socket service.

Furthermore, the feature registry should invoke lifecycle events of the features like on page load or DOM load.

## Feature Modules

Feature modules contain the individual typo features, organized in separate classes. The feature list from the classification will be largely applicable for the separation of the features.

### Feature lifecycle

Features should provide the possibility to be activated and destroyed. Activation contains initialization from the very begin, and destroyal means to remove the feature completely from the DOM and cut ties from events. Activate and destroy are controlled by the user feature selection, activation is additionally called in the init phase of the features (Page Load of the lifecycle module).

Beside these hard resets, a feature should be able to freeze and run.
This is solely to pause a feature while it is not needed - like the image agent when the player is actually not playing.  
Freeze and run is optional - in background features or features where freezing brings no advantage, it can be skipped.  
If a feature implements freeze and run, it has to provide a rxjs pipe factory that can be applied to the global event pipe, which emits either true, false or undefined. This will be used by the feature registry, which then freezes or runs the feature depending on the output.  
While the feature is frozen, it will not receive any events.

### Feature UI

Features should use the Svelte framework to implement their UI.
Features should reside in their own folder, with a feature typescript class file, and svelte components.  
The svelte components should take the feature class as input parameter, and use its methods or stores:
```html
<script lang="ts">
    export let feature: FeatureClass;
    
    const { state } = feature;    
</script>

<div {#if ($state)} >
    <input type="button" on:click={feature.change()}>
</div>
```
