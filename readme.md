# Skribbl-Typo
An extension which adds some extra features to skribbl.io.  
Stable versions are submitted to the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpcilmjlpebjklinlbdjhfkkgmmfghfj).  

When I started coding the extension, I was just trying to add some shortcuts for myself but by the time, the code became quite a mess.  
Though the most parts should be cleaned and reworked, there might still be some bad-practise-parts or german words in it.  

If you recognize any bugs or got suggestions how to improve the code, let me know!  

## ToDo
##### Maybe solve the bugs?  
- First stroke rarely isn't re-drawn  

##### Improvements
- Change CORS bypass to xamlhttp google request
