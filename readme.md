# Skribbl-Typo
An extension which adds some extra features to skribbl.io.  
Stable versions are submitted to the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpcilmjlpebjklinlbdjhfkkgmmfghfj).  

There are some VERY old and messy parts, don't kill me for those.
A complete rework to make it a bit less messy is on my todo.  

Bugs or requests: @Discord tobeh#7437

## ToDo
##### Maybe solve the bugs?  
 * lobby search not triggering sometimes on first lobby
 * lobby buttons sometimes take several clicks 
 * gif progress bar is not consistent

##### Improvements
 * gif drawing speed could be tweaked
 * change jquery parts to vanilla js
 * cleanup on service.js
