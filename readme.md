# Skribbl-Typo
An extension which adds some extra features to skribbl.io.  
Stable versions are submitted to the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpcilmjlpebjklinlbdjhfkkgmmfghfj).  

There are some VERY old parts, don't kill me for those.
A complete rework to make it a bit less messy is on my todo.
