# Skribbl-Typo
An extension which adds some extra features to skribbl.io.  
Stable versions are submitted to the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpcilmjlpebjklinlbdjhfkkgmmfghfj).  

When I started coding the extension, I was just trying to add some shortcuts for myself, but by the time i became more creative while the code became quite a mess.  
Though the most parts should be cleaned and reworked now, there might still be some bad-practise-parts or german words in it.  

If you recognize any bugs or got suggestions on how to improve the code, let me know!
