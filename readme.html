    <h1 id="skribbl-typo">Skribbl-Typo</h1>
<p>An extension which adds some extra features to skribbl.io.<br />
Stable versions are submitted to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpcilmjlpebjklinlbdjhfkkgmmfghfj">Chrome Store</a>.</p>
<p>When I started coding the extension, I were just trying to add some shortcuts for myself and by the time, the code became quite a mess.<br />
Tough the most bits should be cleaned and reworked, there might still be some bad-practise-parts or german words in it.</p>
<p>If you recognize any bugs or got suggestions how to improve the code, let me know!</p>
